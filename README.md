My name is Blake Dennis, but I also frequently go by Halornek online.

I'm interested in pretty much anything computer science related. Hardware, software, networking, etc. I love to tinker with systems and get odd, unnecessary systems to work together in the exact way I want them to.

I'm currently studying for my CompTIA certifications while learning Python and constantly playing around with various Linux applications, particularlly Type 1 Hypervisors.

I can be reached best by email, blake.dennis5793@outlook.com
